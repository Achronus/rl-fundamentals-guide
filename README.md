# Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals Guide

This repository houses the exercises, code snippets, and roadmap for my Reinforcement Learning (RL) fundamentals guide. For those interested, you can view the details on Medium [here](#).

Currently, it is still in development and will be released as an e-book in the future. Chapters that are available can already be viewed on Medium and will remain there indefinitely. You can use the same link above to find them.

The fundamentals covered in this guide intend to fast-track people into RL by giving them the essential information they need to progress from zero knowledge up to Deep RL. The content found within the guide is highlighted in the roadmap below, along with a small discussion on future content after it's completion.

## Roadmap

The roadmap serves to highlight the key aspects of the guide and give readers a lay of the land before diving head-first into it. You can find it below.

You may notice that some of the chapter content is TBC, this is deliberate. At the time of writing it, I am still creating it chapter by chapter, and sometimes it is hard to identify the best content until at the respective chapter. Therefore, the roadmap will be updated as time goes on.

It is worth noting that the main theme of the chapters will remain. For example, Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference methods are planned for the guide, but how their chapters are structured is still being considered.

### Future Content

RL is a large field, especially when it opens up to Deep Learning. In the future, once this guide is complete, I plan to continue my RL journey and will discuss this area in more detail. Some things to look forward to include:

- Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (PPO, DQN, RQDN, etc.)
- Intrinsic Motivation methods
- ... And more!

## Dependencies
